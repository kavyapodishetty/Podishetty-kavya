Decision Tree classification using CART algorithm
==================================================

There are different datasets dealing with different kind of data in it.

These datasets are  related  to particular source like Breast_cancer_data, Diabetes_data , Online_shoppers_data,Titanic_data , mushroom_data.


Operations on Datasets:
=======================

1. Data Collection : All datasets are collected from flexible platform which is " Kaggle ".

2. Dataset with  .csv  format is loaded in to jupyter using  " Pandas " python package.

3. After importing  .csv file into jupyter performed " Data Cleaning " process where all outliers or null values removed from the data.

4. Understanding data is very important so performed well suited " Visualizations " on data which includes graphs , charts etc finally data need to be analyzed in
   this process.

5. Took all classification datasets that suits to build the model called " Decision Tree " for classification 

6. Decision Tree is an Machine Learning algorithm and it can be used for both classification & Regression problems of "Supervised Learning" but it is well suited
   for classification.

8. model is built and checked its accuracy .

9. Performed Boosting and Tuning techniques on the model to improve accuracy of the model.


Technologies and Libraries :
===========================
* Python Programming Language
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* sklearn
